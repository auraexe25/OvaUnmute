# OvaUnmute

> Unmuting Women's Health, One Cycle at a Time

OvaUnmute is an AI-powered application I am developing to address the silent epidemic of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and other menstrual health issues. Affecting a significant portion of women, with many cases going undiagnosed, my mission is to combine empathy and technology to create a personal companion for early detection, emotional support, and raising awareness.

## ✨ Core Features

My platform is being built with several key features to provide holistic support:

* **🤖 AI-Powered Symptom Analysis:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze facial images for early PCOS indicators like acne and hirsutism, offering private insights into hormonal imbalances.
* **🗓️ Intelligent Period Tracker:** An advanced tracker that learns user cycles to flag irregularities and patterns that may be early signs of PCOS.
* **🎮 Gamified Emotion Detection:** Fun, simple games that translate gameplay behavior into mood metrics, tracking a user's emotional state without intrusive questions.
* **❤️ Personalized Suggestions:** Provides mood-based lifestyle suggestions, such as recommending comfort food, music, or breathing exercises to help users feel supported daily.
* **💬 Anonymous Regional Chatbot:** A safe and anonymous chatbot available in multiple Indian languages to answer questions about PCOS, periods, and emotional health.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running for development or testing, follow these simple steps.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/OvaUnmute.git](https://github.com/your_username/OvaUnmute.git)
    ```
2.  Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend folder and install
    npm install

    # Navigate to the backend folder and install
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the development servers (specific commands will vary based on your chosen frameworks, e.g., `npm start` for React Native, `python manage.py runserver` for Django, `uvicorn main:app --reload` for FastAPI).

## 📈 Future Scope

I envision a future where OvaUnmute continues to grow and support women's health comprehensively:

* Integration with wearables for real-time stress and hormone tracking.
* Expansion to cover other women's health issues like endometriosis, PMDD, and menopause.
* Building in-app community support groups.
* Partnerships with NGOs, schools, and health organizations for wider access.
