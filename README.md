# OvaUnmute

> [cite_start]Unmuting Women's Health, One Cycle at a Time [cite: 161]

[cite_start]OvaUnmute is an AI-powered application I am developing to address the silent epidemic of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and other menstrual health issues. Affecting a significant portion of women, with many cases going undiagnosed, my mission is to combine empathy and technology to create a personal companion for early detection, emotional support, and raising awareness[cite: 7, 8, 9, 33].

## ✨ Core Features

My platform is being built with several key features to provide holistic support:

* [cite_start]**🤖 AI-Powered Symptom Analysis:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze facial images for early PCOS indicators like acne and hirsutism, offering private insights into hormonal imbalances[cite: 85, 87, 115].
* [cite_start]**🗓️ Intelligent Period Tracker:** An advanced tracker that learns user cycles to flag irregularities and patterns that may be early signs of PCOS[cite: 83, 103, 104].
* [cite_start]**🎮 Gamified Emotion Detection:** Fun, simple games that translate gameplay behavior into mood metrics, tracking a user's emotional state without intrusive questions[cite: 98, 99, 120].
* [cite_start]**❤️ Personalized Suggestions:** Provides mood-based lifestyle suggestions, such as recommending comfort food, music, or breathing exercises to help users feel supported daily [cite: 100, 101, 148-152].
* [cite_start]**💬 Anonymous Regional Chatbot:** A safe and anonymous chatbot available in multiple Indian languages to answer questions about PCOS, periods, and emotional health[cite: 107, 108, 194].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is being developed with a robust and modern tech stack:

* **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native
* **Frontend (Web):** Next.js / React.js
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI / Django)
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Rasa
* **Database:** PostgreSQL & MongoDB
* **Deployment & Tools:** Docker, AWS/GCP, Postman, VS Code, Git

## 📈 Future Scope

I envision a future where OvaUnmute continues to grow and support women's health comprehensively:
